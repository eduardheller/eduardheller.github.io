Hello, I'm Eduard Heller and I'm currently working as a software developer in Hannover, Germany. I started programming when I was 12 years old and became passionate about game development. The very first programming language I used was Dark Basic. A few months later I switched to Delphi and started my first finished game, a topdown 2D RPG. On this project I learned a lot about game design. I switched to C++ and learned a lot of principles about how a computer works. I also became interested in 3D graphics and learned how graphics cards create images on the screen. I began to understand the graphics pipeline and the importance of learning a game engine and decided to get into Unity3D. I started working with Unity in 2016 and have developed several games to date. In the meantime, I studied Applied Computer Science and was a tutor for computer graphics in my master's program, where I explained the graphics pipeline to students and supervised exercises in OpenGL and C++.  I got a job offer as a research assistant in a virtual reality serious games project, which I accepted and worked as a Unity developer. Today I work as a Fullstack-Developer at the VHV Gruppe, based in Hannover. But I am still looking for opportunities to gain experience and develop games. </p>

<br>
<b>What do I do besides work and programming?</b><br>
I like to play guitar, piano and sing. I played in a rock band during my early 20's as a lead guitarist and singer. I have always enjoyed making music and listening to it. Of course, I also enjoy playing computer games, which naturally fosters my affection for game programming.
