      <description>Technologies: Unity3d Languages: C#  The Terminal: Network has been a hobby project of mine, which is a hacking simulation in a rather dark environment. In this game the player is guided mainly by the console. The player has to fight through different servers to reach the goal and hack servers by solving puzzles in a 3D environment. A robot, controlled by the player, has to solve the puzzles in a programming language similar to BASIC.</description>
