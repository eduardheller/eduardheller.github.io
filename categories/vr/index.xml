      <description>Technologies: Unity3d Languages: C#  In my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis I had to develop a replay system in Unity3d for the already developed framework from my time as a research assistant. Above all, the system should work in a multiplayer environment. The challenge was to develop a deterministic replay system that can contain multiple timelines. The timelines each contain a gameplay of a gaming session. These can be saved, loaded and played back.</description>

      <description>Technologies: Unity3d, Virtual Reality Languages: C#  During my work as a research assistant, we developed a virtual reality framework in Unity3d as a team of six and built a prototype from it.In the scenario, you play a paramedic and have the task of rescuing a child suffering from anaphylactic shock. My responsibilities were the architecture, design and implementation of the virtual reality interactions and network programming of the framework.</description>
