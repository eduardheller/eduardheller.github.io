      <description>During my master thesis I developed a replay system specialized in a Multi-User VR-Environment. I used an already existing 3D-scenario from my work as a research assistent. The System is non-deterministic, which records the game states in a fixed interval and interpolates between them, other than just recording the inputs and simulating the game. The System also supports two optimization algorithms known from Quake 3 and Braid. You can see full details of my integration in my blog post.</description>

      <description>During my work as a research assistant, we developed a virtual reality framework as a team of six people. My areas of responsibility were the architecture, design and implementation of the virtual reality interactions and network programming of the framework.</description>
